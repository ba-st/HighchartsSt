# Usage Examples

After you load the *HighchartsStExamples* and *HighstockStExamples* packages, demo applications will be installed and initialized, so you can explore how to create charts using HighchartsSt.

The only step required to access the examples is to start your Seaside adaptors, for example like this:

```smalltalk
(ZnZincServerAdaptor port: 9999)
   	codec: GRPharoUtf8Codec new;
   start.
```

And then watch the live examples with your browser in `http://localhost:9999/HighchartsDemo` and `http://localhost:9999/HighstockDemo`

You can check how the charts are built by browing *HighchartsDemo* and *HighstockDemo*.
