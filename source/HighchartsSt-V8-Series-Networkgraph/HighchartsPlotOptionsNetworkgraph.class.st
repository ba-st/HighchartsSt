"
A networkgraph is a type of relationship chart, where connnections
(links) attracts nodes (points) and other nodes repulse each other.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all networkgraph series are defined in
plotOptions.networkgraph.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        networkgraph: {
            // shared options for all networkgraph series
        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
        type: ´networkgraph´
    }]
});

If point options other than the data itself are set, for example name or color or custom properties, the grouping logic doesn´t know how to group it.

The joinBy option can also be an array of two values, where the first points to a key in the mapData, and the second points to another key in the data. When joinBy is null, the map items are joined by their position in the array, which performs much better in maps with many data points.
