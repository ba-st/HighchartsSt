Flags are used to mark events in stock charts. They can be added on the
timeline, or attached to a specific series.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all flags series are defined in
plotOptions.flags.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        flags: {
            // shared options for all flags series
        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
