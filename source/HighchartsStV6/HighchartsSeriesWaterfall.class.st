A waterfall series. If the type option
is not specified, it is inherited from chart.type.
For options that apply to multiple series, it is recommended to add
them to the plotOptions.series options structure.

In a column chart, when pointPlacement is &quot;on&quot;, the point will not
create any padding of the X axis. In a polar column chart this means
that the first column points directly north. If the pointPlacement is
&quot;between&quot;, the columns will be laid out between ticks. This is
useful for example for visualising an amount between two points in
time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.
Since Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric,
where 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the
previous, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the
textual options, numeric point placement options won´t affect axis
padding.
Note that pointPlacement needs a pointRange to work. For column series this is
computed, but for line-type series it needs to be set.
For the xrange series type and gantt charts, if the Y axis is a
category axis, the pointPlacement applies to the Y axis rather than
the (typically datetime) X axis.
Defaults to undefined in cartesian charts, &quot;between&quot; in polar
charts.
