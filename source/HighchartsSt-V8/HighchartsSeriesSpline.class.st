"
A spline series. If the type option is
not specified, it is inherited from chart.type.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all spline series are defined in
plotOptions.spline.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        spline: {
            // shared options for all spline series
        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
