Percentage Price Oscillator. This series requires the
linkedTo option to be set and should be loaded after the
stock/indicators/indicators.js and stock/indicators/ema.js.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all ppo series are defined in
plotOptions.ppo.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
