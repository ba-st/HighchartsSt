HighstockAccessibility >> announceNewData [

	"Options for announcing new data to screen reader users. Useful
for dynamic data applications and drilldown.
Keep in mind that frequent announcements will not be useful to
users, as they wonÂ´t have time to explore the new data. For these
applications, consider making snapshots of the data accessible, and
do the announcements in batches.

Should be an object mapping component names to instances of classes
inheriting from the Highcharts.AccessibilityComponent base class.
Remember to add the component to the
keyboardNavigation.order
for the keyboard navigation to be usable.

HighstockAccessibility >> description: aString [

	"A text description of the chart.
Note: Prefer using linkedDescription
or caption instead.
If the Accessibility module is loaded, this option is included by
default as a long description of the chart in the hidden screen
reader information region.
Note: Since Highcharts now supports captions and linked descriptions,
it is preferred to define the description using those methods, as a
visible caption/description benefits all users. If the
accessibility.description option is defined, the linked description
is ignored, and the caption is hidden from screen reader users.

	"Amount of landmarks/regions to create for screen reader users. More
landmarks can make navigation with screen readers easier, but can
be distracting if there are lots of charts on the page. Three modes
are available:

all: Adds regions for all series, legend, menu, information
  region.
one: Adds a single landmark per chart.
disabled: No landmarks are added.
Defaults to all."

HighstockAccessibility >> linkedDescription: aStringOrHighchartsHTMLDOMElement [

	"Link the chart to an HTML element describing the contents of the
chart.
It is always recommended to describe charts using visible text, to
improve SEO as well as accessibility for users with disabilities.
This option lets an HTML element with a description be linked to the
chart, so that screen reader users can connect the two.
By setting this option to a string, Highcharts runs the string as an
HTML selector query on the entire document. If there is only a single
match, this element is linked to the chart. The content of the linked
element will be included in the chart description for screen reader
users.
By default, the chart looks for an adjacent sibling element with the
highcharts-description class.
The feature can be disabled by setting the option to an empty string,
or overridden by providing the
accessibility.description option.
Alternatively, the HTML element to link can be passed in directly as
an HTML node.
If you need the description to be part of the exported image,
consider using the caption feature.
If you need the description to be hidden visually, use the
accessibility.description option.
Defaults to *[data-highcharts-chart='{index}'] + .highcharts-description."

Highcharts will by default attempt to guess the chart type, but for
more complex charts it is recommended to specify this property for
clarity.
