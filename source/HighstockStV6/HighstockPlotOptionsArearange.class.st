	"The Y axis value to serve as the base for the area, for
distinguishing between values above and below a threshold. The area
between the graph and the threshold is filled.

If a number is given, the Y axis will scale to the threshold.
If null, the scaling behaves like a line series with fill between
the graph and the Y axis minimum.
If Infinity or -Infinity, the area between the graph and the
corresponing Y axis extreme is filled (since v6.1.0).
Defaults to nil."

one dimensional arrays of numbers, or two dimensional arrays with
x and y values are allowed. Also, only the first point is tested,
