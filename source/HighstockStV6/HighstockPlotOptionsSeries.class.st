the points become closer than a certain pixel value, determined by
the groupPixelWidth option.
If data grouping is applied, the grouping information of grouped
points can be read from the Point.dataGroup. If point options other than
the data itself are set, for example name or color or custom properties,
the grouping logic doesnÂ´t know how to group it. In this case the options of
the first point instance are copied over to the group point. This can be

that the first column points directly north. If the pointPlacement is
&quot;between&quot;, the columns will be laid out between ticks. This is
useful for example for visualising an amount between two points in
time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.
Since Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric,
where 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the
previous, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the
textual options, numeric point placement options wonÂ´t affect axis
padding.
Note that pointPlacement needs a pointRange to work. For column series this is
computed, but for line-type series it needs to be set.
