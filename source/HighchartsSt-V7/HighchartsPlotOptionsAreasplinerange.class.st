The area spline range is a cartesian series type with higher and
lower Y values along an X axis. The area inside the range is colored, and
the graph outlining the area is a smoothed spline. Requires
highcharts-more.js.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all areasplinerange series are defined in
plotOptions.areasplinerange.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        areasplinerange: {
