"
The X-range series displays ranges on the X axis, typically time
intervals with a start and end date.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all xrange series are defined in
plotOptions.xrange.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        xrange: {
            // shared options for all xrange series
        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
        type: ´xrange´
    }]
});
