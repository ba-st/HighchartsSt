"
A pareto diagram is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph,
where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the
cumulative total is represented by the line.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all pareto series are defined in
plotOptions.pareto.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        pareto: {
            // shared options for all pareto series
        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
        type: ´pareto´
    }]
});

the points become closer than a certain pixel value, determined by
the groupPixelWidth option.
If data grouping is applied, the grouping information of grouped
points can be read from the Point.dataGroup. If point options other than
the data itself are set, for example name or color or custom properties,
the grouping logic doesn´t know how to group it. In this case the options of
the first point instance are copied over to the group point. This can be

The joinBy option can also be an array of two values, where the first
points to a key in the mapData, and the second points to another
key in the data.
When joinBy is null, the map items are joined by their position in
