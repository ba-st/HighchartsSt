"
A sankey series. If the type option is not
specified, it is inherited from chart.type.
In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:

Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
plotOptions.series object.
Options for all sankey series are defined in
plotOptions.sankey.
Options for one single series are given in
the series instance array.

Highcharts.chart(´container´, {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        sankey: {

        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
