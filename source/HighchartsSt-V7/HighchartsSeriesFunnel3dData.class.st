An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values
will be interpreted as y options. The x values will be automatically

and pointInterval given in the series options. If the axis has
categories, these will be used. Example:
data: [0, 5, 3, 5]

An array of objects with named values. The following snippet shows only a
few settings, see the complete options set below. If the total number of data
