"
Options for announcing new data to screen reader users. Useful
for dynamic data applications and drilldown.
Keep in mind that frequent announcements will not be useful to
users, as they wonÂ´t have time to explore the new data. For these
applications, consider making snapshots of the data accessible, and
do the announcements in batches.

HighchartsAccessibilityAnnounceNewData >> announcementFormatter: aHighchartsAccessibilityAnnouncementFormatter [

	"Optional formatter callback for the announcement. Receives
up to three arguments. The first argument is always an array
of all series that received updates. If an announcement is
already queued, the series that received updates for that
announcement are also included in this array. The second
argument is provided if chart.addSeries was called, and
there is a new series. In that case, this argument is a
reference to the new series. The third argument, similarly,
is provided if series.addPoint was called, and there is a
new point. In that case, this argument is a reference to the
new point.
The function should return a string with the text to announce
to the user. Return empty string to not announce anything.
Return false to use the default announcement format.

while an announcement is queued, the queued announcement is
dropped, and the latest announcement is queued instead. Set
to 0 to allow all announcements, but be warned that frequent
announcements are disturbing to users.
