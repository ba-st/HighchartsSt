data

	"An array of data points for the series. For the ohlc series type,
points can be given in the following ways:

An array of arrays with 5 or 4 values. In this case, the values
correspond to x,open,high,low,close. If the first value is a string,
it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value is inferred.
The x value can also be omitted, in which case the inner arrays
should be of length 4. Then the x value is automatically calculated,
either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from pointStart
and pointInterval given in the series options.
data: [
    [0, 6, 5, 6, 7],
    [1, 9, 4, 8, 2],
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 10]
]


An array of objects with named values. The objects are point
configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data
points exceeds the seriesÂ´ turboThreshold,
this option is not available.

    x: 1,
