	"Options for the navigator series. Available options are the same
as any series, documented at <a href='#plotOptions.series'>plotOptions
and <a href='#series'>series.
Unless data is explicitly defined on navigator.series, the data
is borrowed from the first series in the chart.
Default series options for the navigator series are:
series: {
    type: 'areaspline',
    fillOpacity: 0.05,
    dataGrouping: {
        smoothed: true
    },
    lineWidth: 1,
    marker: {
        enabled: false
    }
}
