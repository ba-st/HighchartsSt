accessing
gapSize: aNumber

	"Defines when to display a gap in the graph, together with the gapUnit
option.
When the gapUnit is relative (default), a gap size of 5 means
that if the distance between two points is greater than five times
that of the two closest points, the graph will be broken.
When the gapUnit is value, the gap is based on absolute axis values,
which on a datetime axis is milliseconds.
In practice, this option is most often used to visualize gaps in
time series. In a stock chart, intraday data is available for daytime
hours, while gaps will appear in nights and weekends.
Defaults to 0."
