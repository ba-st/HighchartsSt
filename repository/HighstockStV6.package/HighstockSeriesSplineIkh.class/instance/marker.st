marker

	"Options for the point markers of line-like series. Properties like
fillColor, lineColor and lineWidth define the visual appearance
of the markers. Other series types, like column series, donÂ´t have
markers, but have visual options on the series level instead.
In styled mode, the markers can be styled with the .highcharts-point,
.highcharts-point-hover and .highcharts-point-select
class names.
