accessing
data

	"An array of data points for the series. For the scatter series
type, points can be given in the following ways:

An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values
will be interpreted as y options. The x values will be automatically
calculated, either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from pointStart
and pointInterval given in the series options. If the axis has
categories, these will be used. Example:
data: [0, 5, 3, 5]


An array of arrays with 2 values. In this case, the values correspond
to x,y. If the first value is a string, it is applied as the name
of the point, and the x value is inferred.
data: [
    [0, 0],
    [1, 8],
    [2, 9]
]


An array of objects with named values. The objects are point
configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data
points exceeds the series´ turboThreshold,
this option is not available.
data: [{
    x: 1,
    y: 2,
    name: &quot;Point2&quot;,
    color: &quot;#00FF00&quot;
}, {
    x: 1,
    y: 4,
    name: &quot;Point1&quot;,
    color: &quot;#FF00FF&quot;
}]
