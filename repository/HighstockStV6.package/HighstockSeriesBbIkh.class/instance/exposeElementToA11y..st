accessing
exposeElementToA11y: aBoolean

	"By default, series are exposed to screen readers as regions. By enabling
this option, the series element itself will be exposed in the same
way as the data points. This is useful if the series is not used
as a grouping entity in the chart, but you still want to attach a
description to the series.
Requires the Accessibility module.
Defaults to undefined."
