tickInterval: aNumber

	"The interval of the tick marks in axis units. When null, the tick
interval is computed to approximately follow the <a href='#xAxis.
tickPixelInterval'>tickPixelInterval on linear and datetime axes. On categorized axes,
a null tickInterval will default to 1, one category. Note that
datetime axes are based on milliseconds, so for example an interval
of one day is expressed as 24 * 3600 * 1000.
On logarithmic axes, the tickInterval is based on powers, so a tickInterval
of 1 means one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. A tickInterval
of 2 means a tick of 0.1, 10, 1000 etc. A tickInterval of 0.2 puts
a tick on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 etc.
If the tickInterval is too dense for labels to be drawn, Highcharts
may remove ticks.
If the chart has multiple axes, the <a href='#chart.alignTicks'>alignTicks
option may interfere with the tickInterval setting.
Defaults to null."
