stickyTracking: aBoolean

	"Sticky tracking of mouse events. When true, the mouseOut event
on a series isn&#39;t triggered until the mouse moves over another series,
or out of the plot area. When false, the mouseOut event on a
series is triggered when the mouse leaves the area around the series&#39;
graph or markers. This also implies the tooltip when not shared. When
stickyTracking is false and tooltip.shared is false, the tooltip will
be hidden when moving the mouse between series. Defaults to true for line
and area type series, but to false for columns, pies etc.
Defaults to true."
