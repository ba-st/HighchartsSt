pointIntervalUnit: aString

	"On datetime series, this allows for setting the
<a href='#plotOptions.series.pointInterval'>pointInterval to irregular time 
units, day, month and year. A day is usually the same as 24 hours,
but pointIntervalUnit also takes the DST crossover into consideration
when dealing with local time. Combine this option with pointInterval
to draw weeks, quarters, 6 months, 10 years etc.
