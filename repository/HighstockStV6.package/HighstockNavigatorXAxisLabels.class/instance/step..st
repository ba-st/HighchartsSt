accessing
step: aNumber

	"To show only every nÂ´th label on the axis, set the step to n.
Setting the step to 2 shows every other label.
By default, the step is calculated automatically to avoid
overlap. To prevent this, set it to 1. This usually only
happens on a category axis, and is often a sign that you have
chosen the wrong axis type.
