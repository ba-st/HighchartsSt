Options for the Boost module. The Boost module allows certain series types
to be rendered by WebGL instead of the default SVG. This allows hundreds of
thousands of data points to be rendered in milliseconds. In addition to the
WebGL rendering it saves time by skipping processing and inspection of the
data wherever possible.
In addition to the global boost option, each series has a
boostThreshold that defines when the
boost should kick in.
Requires the modules/boost.js module.
