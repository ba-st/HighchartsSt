boostThreshold: aNumber

	"Set the point threshold for when a series should enter boost mode.
Setting it to e.g. 2000 will cause the series to enter boost mode when there
are 2000 or more points in the series.
To disable boosting on the series, set the boostThreshold to 0. Setting it
to 1 will force boosting.
Requires modules/boost.js.
Defaults to 5000."
