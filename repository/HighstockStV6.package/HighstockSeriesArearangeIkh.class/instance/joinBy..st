accessing
joinBy: aStringOrArrayOfString

	"What property to join the mapData to the value data. For example,
if joinBy is &quot;code&quot;, the mapData items with a specific code is merged
into the data with the same code. For maps loaded from GeoJSON, the
keys may be held in each point&#39;s properties object.
The joinBy option can also be an array of two values, where the first
points to a key in the mapData, and the second points to another
key in the data.
When joinBy is null, the map items are joined by their position
in the array, which performs much better in maps with many data points.
This is the recommended option if you are printing more than a thousand
data points and have a backend that can preprocess the data into
a parallel array of the mapData.
