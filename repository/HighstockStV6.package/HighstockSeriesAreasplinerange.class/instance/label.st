label

	"Series labels are placed as close to the series as possible in a
natural way, seeking to avoid other series. The goal of this
feature is to make the chart more easily readable, like if a
human designer placed the labels in the optimal position.
The series labels currently work with series types having a
graph or an area.
Requires the series-label.js module.
