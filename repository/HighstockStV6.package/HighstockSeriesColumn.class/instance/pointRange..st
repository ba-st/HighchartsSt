pointRange: aNumber

	"The X axis range that each point is valid for. This determines the
width of the column. On a categorized axis, the range will be 1
by default (one category unit). On linear and datetime axes, the
range will be computed as the distance between the two closest data
points.
The default null means it is computed automatically, but this option
can be used to override the automatic value.
Defaults to null."
