offset: aNumber

	"The distance in pixels from the plot area to the axis line.
A positive offset moves the axis with itÂ´s line, labels and ticks
away from the plot area. This is typically used when two or more
axes are displayed on the same side of the plot. With multiple
axes the offset is dynamically adjusted to avoid collision, this
can be overridden by setting offset explicitly.
Defaults to 0."
