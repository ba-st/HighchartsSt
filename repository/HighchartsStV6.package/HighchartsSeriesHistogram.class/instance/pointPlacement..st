pointPlacement: aStringOrNumber

	"Possible values: null, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;between&quot;.
In a column chart, when pointPlacement is &quot;on&quot;, the point will
not create any padding of the X axis. In a polar column chart this
means that the first column points directly north. If the pointPlacement
is &quot;between&quot;, the columns will be laid out between ticks. This
is useful for example for visualising an amount between two points
in time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.
Since Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric,
where 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the
previous, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the
textual options, numeric point placement options won&#39;t affect axis
padding.
Note that pointPlacement needs a <a href='#plotOptions.series.
pointRange'>pointRange to work. For column series this is computed, but for
line-type series it needs to be set.
Defaults to null in cartesian charts, &quot;between&quot; in polar charts.
Defaults to between."
