autoRotation: anArrayOfNumber

	"For horizontal axes, the allowed degrees of label rotation
to prevent overlapping labels. If there is enough space,
labels are not rotated. As the chart gets narrower, it
will start rotating the labels -45 degrees, then remove
every second label and try again with rotations 0 and -45 etc.
Set it to false to disable rotation, which will
cause the labels to word-wrap if possible.
Defaults to [-45]."
