	"An array of data points for the series. For the scatter3d series
type, points can be given in the following ways:

An array of arrays with 3 values. In this case, the values correspond
to x,y,z. If the first value is a string, it is applied as the name
of the point, and the x value is inferred.
<code class='lang-js'>data: [
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 8, 7],
    [2, 9, 2]
]


An array of objects with named values. The objects are point
configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data
points exceeds the series&#39; <a href='#series.scatter3d.turboThreshold'>turboThreshold,

<code class='lang-js'>data: [{
    x: 1,
    y: 2,
