findNearestPointBy: aString

	"Determines whether the series should look for the nearest point
in both dimensions or just the x-dimension when hovering the series.
Defaults to ´xy´ for scatter series and ´x´ for most other
series. If the data has duplicate x-values, it is recommended to
set this to ´xy´ to allow hovering over all points.
Applies only to series types using nearest neighbor search (not
direct hover) for tooltip.
Defaults to xy."
