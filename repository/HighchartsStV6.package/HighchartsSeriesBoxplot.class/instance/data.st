accessing
data

	"An array of data points for the series. For the boxplot series
type, points can be given in the following ways:

An array of arrays with 6 or 5 values. In this case, the values
correspond to x,low,q1,median,q3,high. If the first value is a
string, it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value
is inferred. The x value can also be omitted, in which case the
inner arrays should be of length 5. Then the x value is automatically
calculated, either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from pointStart
and pointInterval given in the series options.
<code class='lang-js'>data: [
    [0, 3, 0, 10, 3, 5],
    [1, 7, 8, 7, 2, 9],
    [2, 6, 9, 5, 1, 3]
]


An array of objects with named values. The objects are point
configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data
points exceeds the series&#39; <a href='#series.boxplot.turboThreshold'>turboThreshold,
this option is not available.
