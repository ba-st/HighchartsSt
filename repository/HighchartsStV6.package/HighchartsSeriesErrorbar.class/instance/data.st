accessing
data

	"An array of data points for the series. For the errorbar series
type, points can be given in the following ways:

An array of arrays with 3 or 2 values. In this case, the values
correspond to x,low,high. If the first value is a string, it is
applied as the name of the point, and the x value is inferred.
The x value can also be omitted, in which case the inner arrays
should be of length 2. Then the x value is automatically calculated,
either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from pointStart
and pointInterval given in the series options.
data: [
    [0, 10, 2],
    [1, 1, 8],
    [2, 4, 5]
]


An array of objects with named values. The objects are point
configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data
points exceeds the seriesÂ´ turboThreshold,
this option is not available.
data: [{
    x: 1,
    low: 0,
    high: 0,
    name: &quot;Point2&quot;,

    x: 1,
    low: 5,
    high: 5,
