innerSize: aStringOrNumber

	"The size of the inner diameter for the pie. A size greater than 0
renders a donut chart. Can be a percentage or pixel value. Percentages
are relative to the pie size. Pixel values are given as integers.
Note: in Highcharts &lt; 4.1.2, the percentage was relative to the plot
area, not the pie size.
Defaults to 0."
