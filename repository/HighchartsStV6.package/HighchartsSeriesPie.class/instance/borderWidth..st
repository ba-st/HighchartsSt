accessing
borderWidth: aNumber

	"The width of the border surrounding each slice.
When setting the border width to 0, there may be small gaps between
the slices due to SVG antialiasing artefacts. To work around this,
keep the border width at 0.5 or 1, but set the borderColor to
null instead.
In styled mode, the border stroke width is given in the .highcharts-point class.
Defaults to 1."
