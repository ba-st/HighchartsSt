stickyTracking: aBoolean

	"Sticky tracking of mouse events. When true, the mouseOut event
on a series isn&#39;t triggered until the mouse moves over another series,
or out of the plot area. When false, the mouseOut event on a
series is triggered when the mouse leaves the area around the series&#39;
graph or markers. This also implies the tooltip. When stickyTracking
is false and tooltip.shared is false, the tooltip will be hidden
when moving the mouse between series.
Defaults to false."
