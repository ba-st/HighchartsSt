minorTickInterval: aNumberOrString

	"Specific tick interval in axis units for the minor ticks.
On a linear axis, if &quot;auto&quot;, the minor tick interval is
calculated as a fifth of the tickInterval. If null, minor
ticks are not shown.
On logarithmic axes, the unit is the power of the value. For example,
setting the minorTickInterval to 1 puts one tick on each of 0.1,
1, 10, 100 etc. Setting the minorTickInterval to 0.1 produces 9
ticks between 1 and 10, 10 and 100 etc.
If user settings dictate minor ticks to become too dense, they donÂ´t
make sense, and will be ignored to prevent performance problems.
