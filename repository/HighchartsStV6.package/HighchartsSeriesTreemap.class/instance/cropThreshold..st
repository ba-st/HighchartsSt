	"When the series contains less points than the crop threshold, all
points are drawn, event if the points fall outside the visible plot
area at the current zoom. The advantage of drawing all points (including
markers and columns), is that animation is performed on updates.
On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the
crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points
that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible
points is to increase performance on large series.
Defaults to 300."
