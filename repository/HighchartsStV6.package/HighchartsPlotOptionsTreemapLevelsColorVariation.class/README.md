A configuration object to define how the color of a child varies from the
parent´s color. The variation is distributed among the children of node.
For example when setting brightness, the brightness change will range
from the parent´s original brightness on the first child, to the amount
set in the to setting on the last node. This allows a gradient-like
color scheme that sets children out from each other while highlighting
the grouping on treemaps and sectors on sunburst charts.
