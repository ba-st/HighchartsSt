minPointLength: aNumber

	"The minimal height for a column or width for a bar. By default,
0 values are not shown. To visualize a 0 (or close to zero) point,
set the minimal point length to a pixel value like 3. In stacked
column charts, minPointLength might not be respected for tightly
packed values.
Defaults to 0."
