compare: aString

	"Compare the values of the series against the first non-null, non-
zero value in the visible range. The y axis will show percentage
or absolute change depending on whether compare is set to &quot;percent&quot;
or &quot;value&quot;. When this is applied to multiple series, it allows
comparing the development of the series against each other.
Defaults to undefined."
