## Installation
HighchartsSt has been tested and used in [Pharo](https://www.pharo.org), [GemStone/S 64](https://gemtalksystems.com/products/gs64/) and [VA Smalltalk](http://www.instantiations.com/products/vasmalltalk/index.html), but should likely work in other dialects too.

The builder (the tool that auto-generates the code), however, only works on Pharo.

### Prerequisites

By default we load the stable version of [Seaside](http://seaside.st), but the wrapper will likely work on any Seaside 3 version. So you can lock the Seaside baseline to whatever version you're using.

### Basic Installation

You can load the framework with (change master to some released version if you wan't a pinned version):

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
	baseline: 'HighchartsSt';
	repository: 'github://ba-st/HighchartsSt:master/repository';
	load.
```

### Loading groups

There's several groups to choose when loading:

- `Highcharts` will load the runtime support for Highcharts
- `Highstock` will load the runtime support for Highstock
- `Tools` will load the code generation tool
- `Development` will load all the packages including the tests and the code generation tool

## Getting Started

To have Highcharts working, the only thing you must do is to register the wanted HighchartsLibrary into your app root class (notice there are 3 possible subclasses of it). Example:

```smalltalk
yourApp
		addLibrary: JQDevelopmentLibrary;
		addLibrary: Highcharts6OnlineLibrary.
```

Then you can render a basic chart like this:

```smalltalk
renderBarGovermentComputersChartOn: html

	| chart series data |

	data := OrderedCollection new
		add: (ChartDatum belongingTo: 'Facebook' withValue: 515333);
		add: (ChartDatum belongingTo: 'YouTube' withValue: 178001);
		add: (ChartDatum belongingTo: 'GMail' withValue: 154504);
		add: (ChartDatum belongingTo: 'Twitter' withValue: 184083);
		add: (ChartDatum belongingTo: 'Amazon' withValue: 100762);
		add: (ChartDatum belongingTo: 'Pandora' withValue: 78868);
		yourself.
	series := ChartSeries named: 'John' composedOf: data.

	html text: 'chart: '.
	chart := html highcharts newChart.
	chart yAxis title text: 'Visits'.
	chart legend enabled: false.
	chart chart type: 'column'.
	chart title text: 'Sites visited on D.C. government computers'.
	chart subtitle text: 'Source: District of Columbia'.
	chart xAxis title text: 'Site'.
	chart xAxis type: 'category'.
	chart plotOptions column colorByPoint: true.
	chart plotOptions column dataLabels enabled: true.
	(chart addSeriesForType: 'column')
		index: 0;
		name: series name;
		data: (series dataAsPointsOn: html).
	html div script: chart
```

The default installation of Highcharts includes some examples. You can start your Seaside adaptors, for example like this:

```smalltalk
(ZnZincServerAdaptor port: 9999)
   	codec: GRPharoUtf8Codec new;
   start.
```

And then watch the live examples with your browser in `http://localhost:9999/HighchartsDemo`


## Running the tests

Tests are auto-generated for the auto-generated code. These are under the packages `HighchartsStV6-Tests` and `HighstockStV6-Tests`. We warned that there's more than 40K test so it will take a while to run, and later be shown in the Test Runner.

## Future work
Besides the [issues](https://github.com/Mercap/HighchartsSt/issues), the following are also desired features:

* Support Highmaps
* Improve documentation
* Improve CI Support to test independently the several groups available
* Deploy the examples to the cloud
* Automatically propose Pull Requests when new versions of Highcharts are available

## Authors

* **The [Mercap](http://www.mercapsoftware.com) Team** and [Maximiliano Tabacman](https://github.com/mtabacman) for the original implementation.
* **The [Quuve](http://www.debrispublishing.com/) Team** and [Mariano Martinez Peck](https://github.com/marianopeck) for the Pharo port and further development and improvements.
